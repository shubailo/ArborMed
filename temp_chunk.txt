ough autosomal dominant means. It is manifested only in the event when the patient encounters some inhalatory narcotics (halothane) or depolarizing muscle relaxants, as seen during surgery, and without this there are no symptoms. Upon the effect of these substances, the abnormality of muscle Ca++ metabolism leads to the spontaneous, unceasing fast rise of an extraordinary extent of metabolism and the body temperature. The myocardium is also affected. Additionally, extreme hyperthermia, acute heart failure, pulmonary edema, shock, DIC, and inevitably, coma, all potentially develop. It is important to be prepared for the possibility of the disease in accordance to the family history, or to recognize the symptoms in time, during surgery. Cooling alone does not solve the problem of the muscle metabolic disorder, and specific treatment (Dantrolene) is required, in addition to cooling. 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
 Treatment with antipsychotic drugs may suddenly induce severe hyperthermia associated with enhanced muscle activity and rhabdomyolysis. The basis is likely due to a change in the activity of central monoamines.
Medical applications of hyperthermia
 Following the Nobel-prize winning discovery of Wagner-Jauregg, in which the premise implies how malaria cures the symptoms of late, incurable neurosyphilis, hyperthermia was used in the first half of the 20th century by neurologists as a form of artificial fever in the treatment of late neurological complications of syphilis and later, in the treatment of other diseases. According to our present knowledge, a high temperature, per se, may indeed be beneficial in conquering several infections, (please note the biological value of fever, ch. 8.5.3.). Recently local/regional hyperthermia is used in the treatment of certain tumors, and is done so by heating the blood which perfuses the tissues: the critically high temperature is thought to cause more severe damage of the highly vascularized tumors including a high metabolic rate and high multiplication rate, therefore the normal cells are relatively spared. 
8.5.3. FEVER (FEBRIS, PYREXIA)
Definition of fever: 
 Fever is defined as an intense rise in core temperature which is clinically not a passive hyperthermia due to the deficiency of counter-regulation against heat load, but an active temperature elevation due to the altered functional activity of the regulatory centers. At its initiation, the centers misjudge the normal temperature as being too low, thereby, constitute coordinated autonomic and behavioral steps, including wrapping up and/or blanketing, shivering, skin vasoconstriction, etc. These all elevate the core temperature until it reaches the level, in which the new higher value is appreciated by the various centers as now characteristically normal. Thereon, this newly acquired high temperature is maintained and defended against external cold or warm influences. This regulation at the higher level is usually described, using engineering terminology on thermostats, in which the set-point or set-range is shifted to a higher level (Fig. 8.14.). In reality, set-point/range should be considered as a new balance regarding the functioning of several regulatory circles involved in thermoregulation, or affecting it, which circles determine not so much a fixed level, but a zone of core temperature. The zone is not stabile and is dependent upon the diurnal rhythm, in which the upper end measures at or about 37.2 ?C in the morning, and 37.7 ?C by evening (Fig. 8.15.). Values exceeding these are abnormal and may refer to either passive hyperthermia, or active elevation in fever. 
Process of fever:
 A simple febrile reaction can be divided into stages (Fig. 8.20.). At its initiation (stadium incrementi), the body temperature rises due to the afore-mentioned coordinated effector functions, including variable symptoms, dependent upon the speed of the rise, originating from trembling up through entire body shivering, as seen in malaria. During the maintenance phase (stadium fastigii), heat production and heat loss are balanced at a higher level. This stage may involve wavering in temperature, and accordingly, as seen in febris continua with daily ?Tc <1 ?C (e.g. typhus abdominalis); febris remittens: diurnal ?Tc ?1 ?C (e.g. acute bronchitis), febris intermittens: febrile and non-febrile or even hypothermic periods within a day (e.g. sepsis) or febris recurrens: febrile/non-febrile days alternating (e.g. malaria). The maintenance phase may last for shorter or longer periods. The course of fever in this phase likely bears relevance regarding diagnostic value but its diagnostic importance has decreased due to the inclusion of modern diagnostic methods. In the stage of defervescence (stadium decrementi) once again, imbalance is apparent, however, it is now in favor of heat loss, with heavy perspiration and immense sweating.
