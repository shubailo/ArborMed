ncter is positioned primarily below the diaphragm) all serve to enhance the pressure at the lower sphincter of the esophagus and inhibit reflux from the low-pressure stomach. In contrast, VIP, ?-adrenergic effects, dopamine, NO, prostaglandins, acidic pH, chocolate, theophylline-like substances, alcohol and hot drinks all serve in helping GERD. In the case of GERD, the acidic stomach content may cause reflux esophagitis, demonstratively and clinically defined as gastric burning, subjectively described as heartburn, since this state resembles angina pectoris. The symptoms are increasingly pronounced, specifically when the patient is in the supine position. The chronic, everlasting presence leads to the tendency and development of metaplasia. The returning acidic gastric content may cause chronic laryngitis, tracheobronchitis, and a host of diagnostic problems. Quite often otorhinolaryngologists or pulmonologists discover and diagnose GERD among patients. Regarding treatment, and in addition to a low-volume, low-fat and no-alcohol containing diet, the suppression of gastric acid production (PPI = proton pump inhibitors) is important, although the lack of acid may alter characteristics of the gut pH and lead to unwanted consequences (gut flora that would need an alkaline milieu may change, what promotes enteral infections such as Clostridium difficile). 
 Diaphragmatic hernia: A near-esophageal part of the diaphragm has a hiatus, and the stomach features a hernial sack at the esophageal-gate. Inflammation may develop in this sack. Recent studies appear to demonstrate similarities of symptoms to those of acid-reflux. The potential for a hernia development includes also other diaphragmatic areas. 
 Diverticulum: The muscular system of the esophagus gradually loosens. A sac-like distension of mucosa is interwoven among the the muscle fibers. In the sac of the diverticulum acidic endproducts are formed by the remains of nutrients and the process of their breakdown, often resulting in chronic inflammatory state of the mucosa. 
 Varicosity on the lower portion of the esophagus: varicosity frequently develops in hepatic cirrhosis and other forms of portal hypertension (ch. 7.6.1.7.). The act of swallowing does not increase in difficulty, however, the potentially sensitive thin-walled varices may be injured due to harder food particles or in the act of vomiting, often resulting in immense bleeding.

7.2.1.1. LESS FREQUENT DISORDERS
 Pylorus-stenosis may typically occur among infants. The circular muscles of the pylorus are hypertrophic, and despite the strong contractions of the gastric muscles, these cannot effectively forward the gastric content and cannot normally empty the stomach to the gut. Due to the result of intensely strengthened gastric contractions, colicky abdominal pain is a characteristic result, in which the spastic stomach can be seen and palpated through the thin abdominal wall. The gastric contractions inevitably empty the stomach backwards, an aspect commonly aligned with projectile vomiting, followed by consequent exsiccosis, severe dehydration, and quickly developing severe fasting condition. Projectile vomiting is defined in the stretching of the gastric wall and a substantial increase in pressure within the stomach. Food substance is hurled out of the stomach with significant force, in the form of an arch. Projectile vomiting differs when compared with an infant, seated or held in adult arms, and following a routine feeding, results in belching of recently swallowed air, including a small representation of the milk originally consumed, and is also brought up through the marginalized, weak lower esophageal sphincter this is not accompanied with the typical gastric contractions. Both exsiccosis and the vomiting-induced rapid starvation behaviors are life-threatening situations in infants. This stenosis can be resolved by a relatively simple surgical procedure (small incision on the circular muscle), thus, the potentially risky consequences can be prevented. 
 In adults, the stenosis and narrowing of the pylorus may develop due to tumors, to scarring of a peptic ulcer, or in transient functional form as a pyloric cramp. 
 Gastric atonia (paralysis) is yet another acutely life-threatening abnormality. It is known to be most frequently a consequence of autonomic neuropathies, however, it may develop upon any peritoneal damage, specifically, an abdominal surgical procedure. It is more frequently apparent among seniors. The atonic stomach exhibits neither mixing nor peristaltic activity, therefore, it cannot empty its content either towards the gut or backwards by the act of vomiting. The passive stretch enhances the secretion of gastric juice, consequently, the stomach volume rapidly increases, progressively increasing the stretch and secretion. Since the plasma is the only source of the
