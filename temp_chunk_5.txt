- other components of healthy feeding (e.g. energy intake satisfying the actual needs).
2. Hormones
 a) - GH (growth hormone) 
 GH is produced in the anterior pituitary. Its secretion is pulsatile (circadian, 1-2-h after sleep onset it starts rising, during the night its level is higher than during daytime); the hypothalamic GHRH stimulates, somatostatin (somatotrop release inhibiting factor - SRIF) inhibits its secretion. Further stimulants of GH secretion are hypoglycemia, physical exercise, protein-rich food, glucagon, pyrogens, Lys-vasopressin, ?-adrenergic effects, stress, sleep, dopamine and its agonists. Inhibitors are hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, ?-adrenergic effects (through inducing hyperlipemia), cortisol, REM sleep and IGF-I (by negative feedback).
 Upon the effect of GH glucose uptake decreases in some tissues (muscle), while glucose output from the liver increases, hence hyperglycemia develops with an insulin antagonist effect (diabetogenic hormone, it also decreases the number of insulin receptors). It enhances lipolysis and protein synthesis (in the latter effect it is an insulin synergist).
 GH effects on bone development are exerted through peptide substances, insulin-like growth factors (IGF, earlier name: somatomedines) that are produced mainly in the liver (partly in the bone and other tissues). The IGF name originates from the finding that they exert an insulin-like effect in the plasma, which effect cannot be suppressed by antibodies against insulin (NSILA = non-suppressible insulin-like activity). Upon GH effect IGF-I is produced, while human choriogonadotropin (hCG) induces production of IGF-II during the prenatal development. IGF-I effects: the enchondral part of the epiphyseal plate thickens, incorporation of chondroitine-sulfate into the cartilage increases and more hydroxyproline is built in into the matrix. The hepatic IGF-I exerts its actions by the classic endocrine mechanism, while the IGF-I secreted in the chondrocytes of the bone acts in a paracrine way, and it also helps the proliferation and maturation of cartilage and fibroblasts.

 - Thyroid hormones
 - Sexual hormones
 - Insulin
 - D-vitamin (D-hormone)
3. Growth factors
 Stimulators of cellular growth and proliferation: nerve growth factor (NGF), transforming growth factors (TGF-? and -?), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), colony-stimulating factors (CSF-s), interleukins (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-?).
4. Other factors
 Normal set of chromosomes, intact liver and kidney function, healthy heart and circulation and normal red blood cells are also necessary for growth. In assessment of growth, the height of parents and ancestors should also be considered (genetic factors), and in puberty the general rate of development should also be taken into account. 
10.3.2. DWARFISM (nanism)
1. Pituitary dwarfism: GH deficiency (insufficient secretion or effect) with consequent IGF-I deficiency. The GH deficiency (or decreased effect) may be:
- hypothalamic origin (hypothalamic or infundibular injury, GHRH-deficiency: very rare)
 - pituitary origin (isolated GH-deficiency with distinct inheritance, congenital lack of pituitary gland, perinatal brain trauma, craniopharyngeoma, basal meningitis, encephalitis). Substitution of hrGH prior to closure of the epiphyseal plates may be effective (with catch-up growth the contemporaries may be reached).
- Laron dwarf: Very rare, around 60 pedigrees are known world-wide. The GH-level is normal or high, but there is no IGF-I. Its underlying cause is GH-receptor defect, therefore the GH-administration is useless. Timely IGF-I substitution is the choice of therapy. Bears the name of Zvi Laron, who described this defect. He was born in 1917 in Cernovci, Bukovina (used to be part of the extinct Austro-Hungarian Monarchy). Started medical studies at Timisoara (Temesvr) then emigrated to Israel and graduated at the Hadassah University. He is emeritus professor of pediatrics at Harvard University, Boston, Ma.
- Pigmy dwarf: The GH- and the IGF-I-level level is normal, the IGF-II-level is often low. Most likely it is a target-organ resistance of genetic origin. 
 In GH-deficiency, the pituitary dwarfs are <140 cm, proportional, their mental development is normal (normal IQ). The sexual development is often normal, but could also be impaired. An infantile character is sometimes observed. Missing GH often leads to subcutaneous lipid deposition (depending on caloric intake) due to the lack of its lipolytic effect, hence these children appear somewhat puffy. Growth retardation cannot be noticed in babies, the suspicion arises at the age of 1-1.5 years of age, conspicuous symptoms are observed later. Occasionally it may be coupled with a tendency for hypoglycemia. Diagnosis: Inducibility of GH secretion by hypoglycemia or by GHRH analogue is lost.
2. Growth retardation may be partially or totally independent of
