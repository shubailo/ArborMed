10. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ENDOCRINE SYSTEMS
 By definition hormones are substances formed at certain parts of the bod (mostly these are the endocrine glands) and delivered by the bloodstream to their remote target sites where they exert their specific effects. They substantially influence the function of diverse organs or organ systems conducting their normal or pathologic operation. Distinct endocrine systems could be dissected (for didactic purposes) according to the hormones produced and their uttermost typical organ-effects, but most hormones actually exert a wide array of actions on the integrated and coordinated functioning of the whole body. Along this line endocrine anomalies alter the function of particular target organs (e.g.: sex-specific effects of gonadal hormones in reproduction) but also have systemic effects all over the body (e.g.: gonadal hormones modify atherosclerosis that leads to circulatory pathologies, or bone rebuilding that is essential in development of osteoporosis etc.)
10.1. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL BASES OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
10.1.1. HORMONES AND THEIR WAYS OF ACTION 
 The mechanisms of hormonal action and the pathological alterations thereof could be investigated by focusing on the following targets:
1.: Synthesis and secretion of hormones with distinct structures and regulation thereof.
2.: Transport of hormones to the target cells and their metabolism/degradation
3.: Receptor functions (mechanisms of hormone-binding receptor activation, stimulated signal transduction pathways and their intracellular targets)
4.: Alterations of hormonal effects in pathologic conditions or along with treatments thereof and in special circumstances either of endocrine or of non-endocrine origin.
 In the classical endocrine actions, various hormones must enter the circulation. Here most of them are bound to transport proteins (e.g. albumin). The level of the transport protein might modulate the hormonal effect since the majority of a given hormone circulates in the bound form, but only the free hormone molecules exert their biological activities.
