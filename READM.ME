# 🩺 MedBuddy: Gamified Medical Education

**MedBuddy** is a cross-platform mobile application that transforms rigorous medical study into a cozy, gamified experience. It combines advanced pedagogical algorithms with "cozy game" mechanics to improve retention and motivation for medical students.

## 🌟 Core Loop: "Learn to Earn, Build to Relax"

The application is built on a simple but powerful loop:
1.  **Study**: Complete adaptive quizzes to master medical topics (Haematology, Cardiology, etc.).
2.  **Earn**: Correct answers reward you with **Stethoscopes (Coins)** and **XP**.
3.  **Build**: Spend coins in the **Medical Supply Shop** to buy meaningful equipment (e.g., ECG monitors, anatomical posters, cozy furniture).
4.  **Customize**: Decorate your personal virtual **Clinic/Study Room** with your unlocked items.

## 🧠 The Quiz System (The "Brain")

MedBuddy isn't just a random question generator. It uses two advanced learning engines:

### 1. Bloom's Taxonomy "Climber" 🧗
The app adapts to your proficiency level using **Bloom's Taxonomy**:
*   **Level 1 (Remember)**: Basic recall facts (e.g., "What is the normal range of...").
*   **Level 2 (Understand)**: Explaining concepts.
*   **Level 3 (Apply)**: Clinical scenarios and diagnosis.
*   **Level 4 (Analyze)**: Complex multi-step case reasoning.

*How it works*: As you answer correctly, you "Level Up" to harder cognitive tiers. If you struggle, the system gently lowers the tier to reinforce basics.

### 2. Spaced Repetition System (SRS) 📅
We use a **Leitner Box System** to ensure long-term retention:
*   **Box 0**: New/Failed questions. Reviewed ASAP.
*   **Box 1-5**: Mastered questions. Only re-appear *just* as you are about to forget them (1 day -> 3 days -> 1 week -> 1 month).
*   *Result*: You spend less time studying what you already know and more time on weak spots.

## 🏥 The Shop & Economy

The **Medical Supply Shop** is where your hard work pays off visually.

*   **Currency**: Stethoscopes (🩺). You earn ~10-20 per correct answer.
*   **Inventory**:
    *   **Medical Equipment**: Gurneys, microscopes, skeletons.
    *   **Decor**: Rugs, plants, coffee machines.
    *   **Upgrades**: Better lighting, wallpapers.
*   **The Room**: Your personal space that evolves with your knowledge. A fully decked-out clinic is a badge of honor showing you have mastered many topics.
