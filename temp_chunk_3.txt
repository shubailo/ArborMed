opin releasing hormone) suppresses LH-FSH (luteinizing hormone follicle stimulating hormone) production/release, while a normal pulsatile GnRH rather stimulates the (pulsatile) LH-FSH production. Down regulation a GnRH receptors might play a role in these phenomena.
 Hormone receptors are usually specific for the given hormone. However, this cannot be absolutized: Occasionally, besides the specific hormone, other hormones of similar structure can bind to the receptors and enhanced hormone activity may develop by this way (spillover phenomenon, e.g. excess cortisol can stimulate the mineralocorticoid receptors, too, resulting in the picture of mineralocorticoid over-activity). The level of the circulating hormone influences the number/density of hormone receptors: persistent high hormone levels suppress the formation of receptors (down-regulation), and the other way around, at low hormone levels the receptor density increases. The up-regulation is rarer: upon hormone binding the number of receptors and the hormone action progressively increase 
10.1.2. REGULATION OF THE FUNCTION OF HORMONE PRODUCING TARGET CELLS: 
 In some instances, this means the hypothalamus pituitary target organ axis feedback-type regulation (e.g. CRF from hypothalamus triggers ACTH release from the pituitary resulting in elevated cortisol levels from the adrenal cortex. High cortisol then gives an inhibitory feedback signal to the hypothalamus and pituitary). In other cases, such axis cannot be demonstrated, the feedback is derived from the hormone action (e.g. secretion of parathormone is regulated by se-Ca++, insulin secretion is regulated by the blood glucose). Not all central hormones have a well-defined peripheral target organ (e.g. growth hormone). Peculiar features of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis are: a./ stimulation of prolactin secretion by TRH (prime target: thyrotrop cells secreting TSH), b./ inhibition of TSH and other trophormones secretion by somatostatin (SS/SRI: somatotrop releasing inhibitor)
10.1.3. ENDOCRINE HYPO- AND HYPERFUNCTIONS
ENDOCRINE HYPOFUNCTION
Causes: decreased hormone production, abnormal hormone variant, disorder of receptors (number, structure, affinity), binding antagonists, deficiency of transport-proteins, disorder of second messengers, intracellular disorder (e.g. hypoxia).
Types: 
- primary (lack/injury of gland, enzyme defects)
- secondary/functional (troph-hormone deficiency, substrate-deficiency, non-specific inhibition, enhanced breakdown/inactivation, antagonist-effect, target-organ resistance)
- tertiary/functional: hypothalamic damage (PRL rises, all others decrease, /TSH to a smaller extent than LH/)
ENDOCRINE HYPERFUNCTION
Causes: increased hormone production, enhanced receptor sensitivity, spillover.
Types:
- primary/autonomic (hormone-producing tumor, ectopic hormone-production, iatrogenic)
- secondary/functional (trop-hormone excess, slow inactivation, receptor oversensitivity)
- tertiary/functional (ectopic releasing-factor /RF/ production, RF-spillover)
10.2. GENERAL DISORDERS OF THE ANTERIOR PITUITARY AND THE HYPOTHALAMUS
10.2.1. HYPOPITUITARISM
In hypopituitarism the secretion of pituitary anterior lobe hormones (trophormones, GH, prolactin) diminishes. If all are affected the condition is called panhypopituitarism. If pituitary stalk is damaged prolactin secretion rises while the others decline.
PATHOGENESIS:
1. tumors: - compression by big adenoma (e.g. chromophobic adenoma)
 - tumor and/or hemorrhage
- hypothalamic tumor (craniopharyngeoma, germinoma, chordoma, 
 meningeoma, glioma etc.)
2. vascular: - SHEEHAN postpartum necrosis (DIC)
 - carotid aneurysm
3. physical destruction:- surgical hypophysectomy or infundibular transection 
 - cranial trauma (basicranial fracture)
 - irradiation
4. inflammation: - granulomatous disease (sarcoidosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis,
 syphilis)
 - eosinophilic granuloma
 - lymphocytic hypophysitis
5. infiltration: - hemochromatosis
 - amyloidosis
 - histiocytosis X
6. developmental abnormalities: - aplasia
 - basal encephalocele
7. isolated hormone deficiencies: (congenital or acquired enzyme defects, or lack of releasing factor)
8. idiopathic (autoimmune?)
SYMPTOMS:
 Various peripheral manifestations are not of the same severity and not simultaneous. There is no severe mineralocorticoid deficiency, since this is regulated mainly by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), only moderate disorder of secretion is expected (manifested e.g. by hypotension) in consequence of the ACTH deficiency-induced generalized adrenal atrophy. Thus, panhypopituitarism can be survived (Quality of life, however, is poor). 
 Table 10.1
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS:
 Anterior pituitary hormones may be missing in isolated form or all hormone production may be impaired in the given order (or simultaneously, e.g. after hypophysectomy), these cases are called panhypopituitarism. 
Sheehans syndrome
 It consists about 25% of adult cases of hypopituitarism. Most often
