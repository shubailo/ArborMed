# Walkthrough: README Update

I have updated the `README.md` file to reflect the project's current state, including Web support and new architectural components.

## Changes

### 1. Platform Support
Updated the introduction to explicitly include **Web**.

```markdown
**ArborMed** is a cross-platform (Mobile + Web + Desktop) application...
```

### 2. Architecture
Added documentation for the **Design System** and **Content Engine**.

```markdown
### **Design System**
A modular ecosystem of widgets and tokens...

### **Content Engine**
A Node.js-based toolchain...
```

### 3. Getting Started
Added instructions for running the app on the Web.

```bash
# Run on Web
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Verification
-   [x] Verified `README.md` content for accuracy and formatting.
